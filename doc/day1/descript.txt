This video includes an explanation of ints, floats, booleans, and strings. Each basic type is further explored by writing some basic V functions and returning them. 

I also briefly discuss ideal ways of setting up conditional statements if/elif/else and showcase some looping techniques for loops in V. 

Array lists are also momentarily discussed in this video, but will be elaborated as this series progresses.

I end the video by showing my audience how to create a simple markdown file by 
redirecting output from a V program.

This video is a reupload from my Twitch live stream. Follow my twitch tosstosstoss to watch future coding sessions as they happen!

Information About V-

github- vlang/v

domain- vlang.io/

description-     
"Simple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software. Compiles itself in 1s with zero dependencies."

"V is a statically typed compiled programming language designed for building maintainable software.
It's similar to Go and is also influenced by Oberon, Rust, Swift.

V is a very simple language. Going through this documentation will take you about half an hour, and by the end of it you will learn pretty much the entire language.

Despite being simple, it gives a lot of power to the developer. Anything you 
can do in other languages, you can do in V."
